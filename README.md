# BT Implementation Pygame

This repository contains an implementation of a **Behavior Tree (BT)** model simulated using **Pygame**.  
In this simulation, a robot is designed to **water plants automatically**. The Behavior Tree controls the robotâ€™s actions, including watering plants, recharging its battery, refilling its water tank, and handling other behaviors dynamically based on environmental conditions.

A visual diagram of the Behavior Tree model is included in this project to illustrate how each node interacts within the decision-making structure.
